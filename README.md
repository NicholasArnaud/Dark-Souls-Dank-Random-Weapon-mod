# Dark Souls Dank Random Weapon mod
This is a Random Weapon mod for Dark Souls III<br />

You can customize the timer for when it switches weapon (Please don't set the timer to 0, because you won't be able to get past the loading screen)<br />


Weapons have random infusion and upgrade level.<br />

The weapon icon won't change when the weapon changes (Update for that coming at some point, waiting for mr. nice shoes)<br />

normal version only contains Weapons and there infusions (no shields, talisman, staff, or bows): https://mega.nz/#!CUU31J6Y!-Fk1jziTFq8GWv7Zo6ATTtU89N_Fdh7K3rq6W3Hh8NY<br />


Shield and Weapon Version only has shields and Weapons and their infusions (no talisman, staff, or bows): https://mega.nz/#!UAZAgQhZ!24SmOW62bb-ppzsoEfCo5rhEjjOTAF51c4O-AHcvuu4<br />

Download link per request from reddit user "Blargh676" removed almost all of the shields and their infsuions, Same Weapons but they have less infusions. https://mega.nz/#!uEkVTKqJ!6iHlHcB_MBhbaOHHm8I2i6Kv0LIweQ4GUAsw7DzMpd4. <br />
