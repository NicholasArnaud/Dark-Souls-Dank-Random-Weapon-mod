# Dark Souls Dank Random Weapon mod
This is a Random Weapon mod for Dark Souls III<br />

You can customize the timer for when it switches weapon (Please don't set the timer to 0, because you won't be able to get past the loading screen)<br />
Only weapons and shields, no talismans, staffs, or bows.<br />

The weapon icon won't change when the weapon changes (Update for that coming at some point, waiting for mr. nice shoes)<br />

Download link for the compiled version here: https://mega.nz/#!eIFGSaZR!5aNHVbULnFvXH2MwK8k-JPCi6hT7l82XtjvZ1ZLVNu0, if you are not able to compile it yourself.<br />

Download link per request from reddit user "Blargh676" it has less infused weapons and shields (Weapons and Sheilds have less infusions): https://mega.nz/#!GEl0kL4B!syTEg6YKkYK67Qu2-nbKM1gvvFGlny-03gIgCfVJTTg. <br />
