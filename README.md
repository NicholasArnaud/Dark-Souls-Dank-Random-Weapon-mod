# Dark Souls Dank Random Weapon mod
This is a Random Weapon mod for Dark Souls III<br />

You can customize the timer for when it switches weapon (Please don't set the timer to 0, because you won't be able to get past the loading screen)<br />
Only weapons and shields, no talismans, staffs, or bows.<br />

Weapons have random infusion and upgrade level.<br />

The weapon icon won't change when the weapon changes (Update for that coming at some point, waiting for mr. nice shoes)<br />
