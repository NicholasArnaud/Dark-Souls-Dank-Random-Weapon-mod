# Dark Souls Dank Random Weapon mod
This is a Random Weapon mod for Dark Souls III<br />

You can customize the timer (in seconds) for when it switches weapon (Please don't set the timer to 0, because you won't be able to get past the loading screen)<br />


Weapons have random infusion and upgrade level.<br />

The weapon icon won't change when the weapon changes (Update for that coming at some point, waiting for mr. nice shoes)<br />

normal version only contains Weapons and there infusions (no shields, talisman, staff, or bows): https://mega.nz/#!LJ1CgIxY!9JeTr29fRA5vkolFmCIUa-th_s_s5JMu5IBjt-EeH6M<br />

Download link per request from reddit user "Blargh676" removed almost all of the shields and their infsuions, Same Weapons but they have less infusions. https://mega.nz/#!7EMXlSra!uKoYRf2YolUq85nYai5aZrS1r11fzhs6JgesVCJA0h0 .<br />
